# Bio-Recap: A Repository for Reanalyzed Research Projects

## Introduction

Welcome to **Bio-Recap** - short for *Recapitulate*. This repository serves a unique purpose: to organize and present a curated list of research projects that have been meticulously reanalyzed. Our goal is to foster a deeper understanding of various research findings by offering a platform where these projects can be revisited and explored in greater detail.

## Purpose

The core mission of **Recap** is to enhance educational experiences in the field of computational biology through project-based learning. By compiling a comprehensive list of reanalyzed research projects, categorized by the type of research experiment, we aim to provide a resource that is both informative and accessible.

## Features

- **Organized Catalogue**: Projects are organized by the type of research experiment, making it easy to navigate through different areas of interest.

- **Comprehensive Analysis Tools**: Each linked project repository includes:
  - Workflow files for streamlined pre-processing.
  - Scripts for figure generation and data summarization.
  - Insights on additional findings and critiques of the original authors' work.

- **Educational Accessibility**: Designed with education in mind, this repository allows users to choose their path through the analysis, catering to different learning needs and objectives.

- **GitHub Pages for Visualization**: Each project repository is accompanied by a GitHub Pages site, offering a visual and summarizable perspective of the data and findings.

## Contributing

**Recap** thrives on community contributions. We encourage you to share your reanalyzed research projects, termed "recaps", with this repository. Whether you're an experienced researcher or a student just beginning your journey in computational biology, your contributions are valuable. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:
- Fork the repository.
- Add your project following the structured format provided.
- Submit a pull request with your additions.

For detailed contribution guidelines, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Usage

To make the most out of **Recap**, start by selecting a project that interests you from the list organized by research experiment type. Each project's repository will guide you through the necessary steps to reanalyze the data, from pre-processing to generating insights and critiques.

## Educational Impact

We believe that project-based learning is paramount in mastering computational biology. **Recap** is not just a repository; it's a learning platform designed to be at the forefront of educational resources in the field. By engaging with **Recap**, you're not just observing; you're actively participating in the scientific process, enhancing your skills and knowledge.
