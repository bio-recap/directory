Welcome to Bio-Recap - short for Recapitulate. This repository serves a unique purpose: to organize and present a curated list of research projects that have been meticulously reanalyzed. Our goal is to foster a deeper understanding of various research findings by offering a platform where these projects can be revisited and explored in greater detail.


The core mission of Recap is to enhance educational experiences in the field of computational biology through project-based learning. By compiling a comprehensive list of reanalyzed research projects, categorized by the type of research experiment, we aim to provide a resource that is both informative and accessible.
