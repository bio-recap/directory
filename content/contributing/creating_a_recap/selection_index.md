Careful consideration should be taken to select a good publication to recap. Here are some general guidelines:

###### 1. Select a recent publication, ideally within the last 5 years
- Bioinformatics is a fast-paced field with cutting-edge technologies that quickly become outdated.

###### 2. Consider performance requirements for your study
- Bioinformatics is a highly accessible field but some studies are outside the reach of an independent researcher. Take heart in knowing that there are numerous studies that can be carried out with a simple laptop or a cheap cloud compute server.

###### 3. Select something that you are passionate about
- Creating a Bio-Recap is a long and often frustrating process. You will likely run into some dead ends and confusing results. This is how it is supposed to feel and it will get easier. One thing you can do to improve your experience is to choose a study or technique that you enjoy studying.

###### 4. Consider the supporting documentation of the study
- Some studies are laid out perfectly and some studies feel like a knife fight in the dark. Try and find something with a reasonable amount of documentation. Also, don't hesitate to reach out to the authors of the study early on. They are often thrilled to share their work in more depth and will serve as a terrific resource for you.
