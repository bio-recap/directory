This study uncovers the genome-wide targets and physiological functions of the transcription factor Cst6p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By mapping Cst6p's binding sites, it was found that Cst6p binds to the promoter regions of 59 genes when cells are grown on ethanol, influencing various biological functions, but shows minimal binding on glucose. The impaired growth of CST6 deletion mutants on ethanol was linked to reduced expression of NCE103, a direct target of Cst6p and crucial for carbonic anhydrase activity. Cst6p's target genes significantly overlap with those regulated by stress-responsive transcription factors Sko1p and Skn7p. Moreover, CST6 deletion mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to oxidative and ethanol stress on ethanol, positioning Cst6p within the stress-responsive transcriptional regulatory network. This research highlights the condition-dependent nature of transcriptional regulation in yeast and extends our understanding of the complex transcriptional regulatory networks controlling stress responses and growth on different carbon sources.
